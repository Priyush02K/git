What is Markdown?
Markdown exists to shield content creators from the overhead of HTML.

The invention of Markdown offered a great compromise between the power of HTML for content description and the ease of plain text for editing.

HTML provides content headings, such as the <h1> tag. In Markdown, this is supported via the # symbol. Just use one # for each heading level from 1-6.
  Ex
