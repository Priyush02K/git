What is Markdown?
Markdown exists to shield content creators from the overhead of HTML. While HTML is great for rendering content exactly how it was intended, it takes up a lot of space and can be unwieldy to work with, even in small doses. The invention of Markdown offered a great compromise between the power of HTML for content description and the ease of plain text for editing.

This is *italic* text.
This is also _italic_ text.

Declaring headings
HTML provides content headings, such as the <h1> tag. In Markdown, this is supported via the # symbol. Just use one # for each heading level from 1-6.
  Ex
  ###### This is H6 text

  to order
  
  1. First
1. Second
1. Third
  
  
  - First
  - Nested
- Second
- Third.
  
  Building tables
You can construct tables using a combination of pipes (|) for column breaks and dashes (-) to designate the prior row as a header.
  First|Second
-|-
1|2
3|4
  
  
  > This is quoted text.
  
  Here is a<br />line break
  
  ```markdown
var first = 1;
var second = 2;
var sum = first + second;
```
